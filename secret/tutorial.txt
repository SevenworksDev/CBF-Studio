# Geometry Dash Bots are powered by cbf, a very easy to learn Geometry Dash tool.
# Heres how it works.

# You create a category like this:
@greetings

# and below, you add a command (you can add multiple commands under a category):
hello->Hello there!

# Notice the "->"?
# The "->" is known as a cbf arrow seperator.
# It seperates it as "trigger: response"
# So if you comment on a Geometry Dash level with the trigger beginning with your bot prefix, it gives you the response!
# Note that you can set a prefix in "Configuration" so for example:
# hello can be executed by "/hello" if the prefix is "/"
# Isn't that magic enough?



# Thats the cbf basics, keep reading for advanced usage.




# You can also send HTTP and HTTPS requests OR execute commands on your computer to give a bot response also!
# Heres how it works.

# After the arrow seperator, add "http>" or "https>" depending on the websites that you want to fetch.
# or "term>" for terminal commands.

# From there you can do whatever, for example:
@exampleCommands
createEmptyFolderForNoReason->term>mkdir empty && echo "Created empty folder on my desktop!"
doxxMyself->http>ip-api.com/json

# Did you know that since cbf uses the GDBrowser API to fetch comments, its also possible to retrieve extra information without getting ratelimited easily?
# I was shocked when I found that out too.
# These are called info variables.
# Finally for the last time, heres how to use it.

@greetings2
betterHello->Hello {user}, how are you?
goodbye->KILL YOURSELF {user} YOU RUDE PIECE OF SHIT.

# Notice how {user} is in here?
# Well lets say if your GD username is "Smelly" then {user} would be replaced with "Smelly"
# Heres some other info variables you can replace "user" with in {user}:

# Stats: stars, diamonds, coins, demons
# Player: accountID, userID, botUsername, botPassword (for the love of god dont use this in comments)
# Level: levelID
# Etc: os, pythonVersion
# Remind me to make more.

# Thanks for reading the cbf tutorial,
# Thats all folks!

# Heres an example cbf file so I can give you a basic example of what you can make.
# of course if your an amazing coder, cbf is endless.
# If you arent a coder, cbf is still loaded with stuff.

@greetings
hello->Hello, {user}! *waves*
bye->Goodbye, {user}! *waves*
